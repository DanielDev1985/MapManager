Sample code
-----------

**Directions using Apple service**

    var latOrigin = 37.331789
    var lngOrigin = -122.029620
    var coordinateOrigin = CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: latOrigin, longitude: lngOrigin)
    var latDestination = 37.231789
    var lngDestination = -122.029620
    var coordinateDestination = CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: latDestination, longitude: lngDestination)
        
    mapManager.directions(from: coordinateOrigin, to: coordinateDestination) { (route, directionInformation, boundingRegion, error) -> () in
            
        if (error? != nil) {
                
            println(error!)
        }else{
                
            if let web = self.mapView?{
                    
                dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue()) {
                        
                    web.addOverlay(route!)
                    web.setVisibleMapRect(boundingRegion!, animated: true)
                        
                    }
                    
                }
            }
            
        }
            

**Directions using Google service**

    var origin = "Toronto"
    var destination =  "Montreal"
        
    mapManager.directionsUsingGoogle(from: origin, to: destination) { (route, directionInformation, boundingRegion, error) -> () in
            
        if(error != nil){
                
            println(error!)
        }else{
                
            if let web = self.mapView?{
                    
                dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue()) {
                    web.addOverlay(route!)
                    web.setVisibleMapRect(boundingRegion!, animated: true)
                	}
                    
            	}
                
        	}
    	}
